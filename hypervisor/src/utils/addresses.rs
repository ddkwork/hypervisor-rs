//! Abstraction over physical addresses with utility functions for address conversion.
//!
//! This module introduces the `PhysicalAddress` structure that simplifies operations around
//! physical addresses. It provides conversions between virtual addresses (VAs) and physical addresses (PAs),
//! as well as methods for extracting page frame numbers (PFNs) and other address-related information.

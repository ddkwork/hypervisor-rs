//! Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual: 29.3 THE EXTENDED PAGE TABLE MECHANISM (EPT)
//! The extended page-table mechanism (EPT) is a feature that can be used to support the virtualization of physical memory.
//! When EPT is in use, certain addresses that would normally be treated as physical addresses (and used to access memory) are instead treated as guest-physical addresses
//! Guest-physical addresses are translated by traversing a set of EPT paging structures to produce physical addresses that are used to access memory.
//! Credits to the work by Satoshi in their 'Hello-VT-rp' project for assistance and a clear implementation of EPT:
//! https://github.com/tandasat/Hello-VT-rp/blob/main/hypervisor/src/intel_vt/epts.rs

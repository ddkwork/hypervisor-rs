A lightweight, memory-safe, and blazingly fast Rust-based type-2 research hypervisor with hooks for Intel VT-x, focused on studying the core concepts of virtualization.

## Features

- :white_check_mark: **Extended Page Tables (EPT)**: Support for Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR).
- :white_check_mark: **VM Exit Handling**: Handling of `ExceptionOrNmi (#GP, #PF, #BP, #UD)`, `Cpuid`, `Getsec`, `Vmcall`, `Vmclear`, `Vmlaunch`, `Vmptrld`, `Vmptrst`, `Vmresume`, `Vmxon`, `Vmxoff` `Rdmsr`, `Wrmsr`, `Invd`, `Rdtsc`, `EptViolation`, `EptMisconfiguration`, `Invept`, `Invvpid`, `Xsetbv`.
- :white_check_mark: **Hidden Kernel Inline Hooks**: PatchGuard-compatible breakpoint (`int3`) hooks.
- :white_check_mark: **Hidden System Call (Syscall) Hooks**: PatchGuard-compatible hooks for System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function entries.

## Planned Enhancements

- :x: **Isolation and Security**: Development of custom implementations for Global Descriptor Table (GDT), Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and Page Tables to enhance security. Aiming to reduce dependency on the host's `ntoskrnl.exe` `CR3`. [Credits to @namazso](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2779560-post4.html).

## Supported Hardware

- :white_check_mark: Intel processors with VT-x and Extended Page Tables (EPT) support.
- :x: AMD processors with AMD-V (SVM) and Nested Page Tables (NPT) support.

## Supported Platforms

- :white_check_mark: Windows 10 - Windows 11, x64 only.

## Installation

1. Install Rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Switch to Rust Nightly: `rustup toolchain install nightly` and `rustup default nightly`.
3. Install LLVM: `winget install LLVM.LLVM`.
4. Install Tools: `cargo install cargo-make cargo-expand cargo-edit cargo-workspaces`.
5. Install WDK/SDK/EWDK: Steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

## Building the Project

- Development: `cargo make --profile development`.
- Production: `cargo make --profile release`.

## Debugging

#### Enabling Debug Modes

- Test Mode: Activate test signing with `bcdedit.exe /set testsigning on`.
- Windows Debugging: Follow the steps in this [Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bcdedit--bootdebug).

```powershell
bcdedit.exe /bootdebug {bootmgr} on
bcdedit.exe /bootdebug on
bcdedit.exe /debug on
```

#### Network Debugging with Windbg

Setup: `bcdedit.exe /dbgsettings net hostip:w.x.y.z port:n`.

#### Debug Print Filter

1. Open `regedit.exe`.
2. Go to `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.
3. Create `Debug Print Filter` with `DEFAULT` DWORD = `8`.

#### VMware Serial Port Debugging

1. Add Serial Port in VMware: 'Use output file'.
2. Configure in Windows VM: `$serialPort = New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort COM2,9600,None,8,One; $serialPort.Open()`.

#### Service Management

Use Service Controller (`sc.exe`) to create and manage the hypervisor service:

```powershell
sc.exe create matrix type= kernel binPath= C:\Windows\System32\drivers\matrix.sys
sc.exe query matrix
sc.exe start matrix
```

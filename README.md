# Windows Blue Pill Type-2 Hypervisor in Rust (Codename: Matrix)

Blog: https://memn0ps.github.io/hypervisor-development-in-rust-part-1/

This is a Rust-based research hypervisor for Intel VT-x virtualization, designed to be lightweight and focused on studying the core concepts. While it currently lacks memory management unit (MMU) virtualization using Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT), this feature is planned for future implementation.

Credit and gratitude are extended to the following individuals and their respective repositories for their invaluable contributions and references: [@daax_rynd](https://revers.engineering/7-days-to-virtualization-a-series-on-hypervisor-development/), [@Intel80x86](https://github.com/SinaKarvandi/Hypervisor-From-Scratch/), [@not_matthias](https://github.com/not-matthias/amd_hypervisor), and [@standa_t](https://github.com/tandasat/Hypervisor-101-in-Rust).

This project also follows a similar neat structure to the [amd_hypervisor made by @not-matthias](https://github.com/not-matthias/amd_hypervisor), which facilitates potential integration with other open-source projects, if necessary.

The inspiration for this endeavor emerged shortly after the release of [@not_matthias](https://github.com/not-matthias/amd_hypervisor)'s AMD (SVM) Hypervisor in Rust, along with the enlightening articles by [Secret Club](https://twitter.com/the_secret_club) and the unveiling of [DarthTon's HyperBone](https://github.com/DarthTon/HyperBone) on [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/c-and-c-/173560-hyperbone-windows-hypervisor.html):

By leveraging the knowledge gained from these resources and building upon them, I aim to explore and contribute to the field of hypervisor development in Rust.

## Features

- Type-2 Intel VT-x Hypervisor (under development): This hypervisor is being developed with a focus on Intel VT-x virtualization. The following features are currently in progress:
    - Extended Page Tables (EPT)
    - Model Specific Register (MSR) Bitmaps

- Type-2 AMD SVM Hypervisor Integration: Integration of AMD SVM (Secure Virtual Machine) hypervisor support is planned for future development.

By combining these features, my goal is to create a comprehensive hypervisor solution that supports both Intel VT-x and AMD SVM virtualization technologies. I'm actively working on the Intel VT-x hypervisor and have plans to integrate the AMD SVM hypervisor in the future.

## Install

### [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

To start using Rust, [download the installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then run the program and follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to install the [Visual Studio C++ Build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) when prompted to do so.


### [Install and change to Rust nightly](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html)

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

### [Install cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make)

```
cargo install cargo-make
```

### [Install WDK/SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

* Step 1: Install Visual Studio 2022
* Step 2: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 SDK
* Step 3: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 WDK

## Build

Change directory to `.\driver\` and build driver and hypervisor

```
cargo make sign
```

### Enable `Test Mode` or `Test Signing` Mode 

```
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

### [Optional] Debug via Windbg

```
bcdedit /debug on
bcdedit /dbgsettings net hostip:<IP> port:<PORT>
```

### [Optional] Debug Print Filter

* Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`
* Create a new Key called `Debug Print Filter`
* Create a new `DWORD (32) Value`
* Give it the name `DEFAULT`
* Give it the `Value data: 8`

## Create / Start Service

```
sc.exe create matrix type= kernel binPath= C:\Windows\System32\drivers\matrix.sys
sc.exe query matrix
sc.exe start matrix
```

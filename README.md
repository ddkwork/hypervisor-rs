This project is a Rust-based research hypervisor (type-2) for Intel VT-x virtualization, designed to be lightweight and focused on studying the core concepts.

## Features

- **Vmexit Management for Optimized Virtualization**:
  - **CPUID**: Efficient handling of CPUID vmexits.
  - **RDMSR & WRMSR**: Supports Read and Write operations for Model-Specific Registers, including synthetic MSRs.
  - **INVD**: Implements INVD vmexits for cache invalidation.
  - **RDTSC**: Manages RDTSC instruction vmexits for accurate time-stamp counter values.
  - **XSETBV**: Manages Extended State Save/Restore (xsetbv) vmexits.
- **GDT and IDT Implementation**: Custom development of the Global Descriptor Table and Interrupt Descriptor Table, vital for safeguarding against malicious guests. [Learn more](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/2779560-post4.html).
- **Future Development Plans**:
  - **VM Exit Instruction Handling**: Including GETSEC and VMX instructions (INVEPT, INVVPID, VMCALL, VMCLEAR, VMLAUNCH, VMPTRLD, VMPTRST, VMRESUME, VMXOFF, VMXON).
  - **Extended Page Tables (EPT)**: For advanced memory management.

## Installation

1. **Install Rust**: Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. **Switch to Rust Nightly**: Run `rustup toolchain install nightly` and `rustup default nightly` in PowerShell.
3. **Install LLVM**: Required for `bindgen`. Install via `winget install LLVM.LLVM`.
4. **Install Additional Tools**: `cargo-make`, `cargo-expand`, `cargo-edit`, and `cargo-workspaces` (optional but recommended for enhanced development experience).
5. **Install WDK/SDK/EWDK**: Necessary for Windows drivers. Follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk).

## Building the Project

- **Development Build**: Run `cargo make --profile development` in PowerShell.
- **Production Build**: Run `cargo make --profile release` in PowerShell.

## Debugging

### Enabling Debugging Modes

- **Test Mode**: Activate by running `bcdedit.exe /set testsigning on` in an elevated command prompt.
- **Windows Boot Debugging**: Enable debugging for key Windows components - Boot Manager, Boot Loader, and Kernel. This setup triggers a debugger break at three critical startup stages. For detailed instructions, see [Windows Hardware Drivers documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bcdedit--bootdebug):

```powershell
  bcdedit.exe /bootdebug {bootmgr} on
  bcdedit.exe /bootdebug on
  bcdedit.exe /debug on
```

### Network Debugging with Windbg

Set up network debugging by specifying the host computer's IP and port:

```powershell
bcdedit.exe /dbgsettings net hostip:w.x.y.z port:n
```

### Setting Up Debug Print Filter

To focus debugging messages:

1. Open Registry Editor: `regedit.exe`.
2. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.
3. Create a `Debug Print Filter` key with a `DEFAULT` DWORD value set to `8`.

### Configuring Serial Port for VMware Debugging

Set up serial port communication in VMware for detailed debugging:

1. Add a Serial Port in VMware settings, set to 'Use output file'.
2. In Windows VM, use PowerShell to configure the serial port (e.g., `COM2`, 9600 baud rate). Scripts provided for one-liner:

```powershell
$serialPort = New-Object System.IO.Ports.SerialPort COM2,9600,None,8,One; $serialPort.Open()
```

### Creating and Starting a Service

Use Service Controller (`sc.exe`) to create and manage the hypervisor service:

```
sc.exe create matrix type= kernel binPath= C:\Windows\System32\drivers\matrix.sys
sc.exe query matrix
sc.exe start matrix
```
